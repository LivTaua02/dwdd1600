        <h1>Most Asked Questions</h1>
            <h2 id="concerns">Why should I do skincare?</h2>
            <p>Our skin goes through so much on a daily basis due the environment. These things include:
                <dl>
                <dt>Sun Damage</dt>
                <dd>Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is proven to cause skin cancer. There are 2 types of UV lights that contribute to the risk. UVA is associated with aging skin, and UVB is associated with skin burning. Both are dangerous and increase the risk of skin cancer.</dd>
                <dt>Pollutants</dt>
                <dd>Our skin is the larget organ on the human body. It is constantly protecting us against pollutants and unfortunately over time without proper care can cause irritation, dehydration, premature aging, and even skin cancer. It also often worsens existing skin conditons such as acne, eczema, dermatitis, and psoriasis. Antioxidant rich ingredients will help fight off these effects.</dd>
                <dt>Other Harsh Weather Conditons</dt>
                <dd>The colder weather months can affect the skin severly. It can trigger/worsen conditions such as eczema and xerosis which is a fancy way of saying really dry skin. It is important especially if you are prone to these conditions, to prepare for the colder months and use extra hydrating and moisturizing products. </dd>
                </dl>
            Having a good skincare routine is the only thing that can truly protect our skin against these conditions.<br>Another important reason for skincare is that is helps prevent skin issues such as:
            <ul>
                <li>acne</li>
                <li>dryness</li>
                <li>oilyness</li>
                <li>sensitivity</li>
                <li>discoloration</li>
                <li>textured skin</li>
                <li>fine lines/wrinkles</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The list goes on with what skincare can do for us. Lastly I believe skincare helps us to feel confident and it boosts our self-esteem because when you take time to care for yourself, your body and mind appreciate it. Skincare is a form of selfcare!</p>
            <h2>What order do I do my skincare in?</h2>
            <p>This is a great question! One that stumps many people too. It is always best to start with your 
            <ol>
                <li>cleanser</li>
                <li>then move on to your treatments (only use 1-2 at a time)</li>
                <li>apply a toner</li>
                <li> then any serums (again only 1-2)</li>
                <li>and lastly a moisturizer</li>
                <li>If it is day time, make sure to apply SPF at the end to protect us against sun damage! </li>
            </ol>
                <p>Now this may seem like a lot and if you are a beginner, it is best to start with, a cleanser, a moisturizer, and in the day time an SPF. Once you are comfortable with that you can always begin adding in new products!</p>
            <h2><a href="https://www.skincancer.org/skin-cancer-prevention/sun-protection/sunscreen/#:~:text=When%20used%20as%20directed%2C%20sunscreen,melanoma%20risk%20by%2050%20percent." target="_blank">Do I really need SPF?</a></h2>
            <p>YES! No matter who you are, young, old, women, men, even the people who don't burn, you NEED sunscreen! As I've mentioned, the sun has UVA and UVB rays that cause damage such as loss of skin elasticity, causing wrinkled toughened or thinned skin, but aside from the appearance, it also can cause basal cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and can lead to melanoma which are all types of cancer. It has been shown that if you wear at least SPF 15 as directed daily, it can lower the risk of SCC by 40% and lower melanoma risks by 50% and to protect even furhter make sure it is a broad-spectrum SPF to protect against both UVA rays and UVB rays.</p>
