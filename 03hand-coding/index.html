        <h1>Elevated Essentials Story</h1>
            <h2>Who are we?</h2>
        <p>Elevated Essentials is a skincare brand started by Olivia Tau'a for <strong>everyone</strong> sturggling with their skin. Whether that be from not understanding your skin type ie. dry, oily, combination or you have concerns such as sensitivity, acne-prone skin, aging, etc. or maybe you honestly just need a good go-to routine! Whatever the challenge, we have a solution! </p>
            <h2>Why I created Elevated Essentials.</h2>
        <p>I originally started Elevated Essentials as a social media account talking about my own skin struggles with having gone through severe cystic acne since the young age of 10 years old, and having sensitivity, extreme dryness and painful eczema my whole life. Not only did these things affect my skin, but it also affected my self worth. It was a constant battle of trying to find what works and doesn't and learning to love myself regardless of the issues I dealt with. <a href="FAQs.html#concerns">It was important for me to find a reliable routine with these issues</a> and I realized how many people go through similar experiences as mine, so I was inspired to create my own line. Thus being born, Elevated Essentials! </p>
            <h2>What you'll love about us!</h2>
        <p>There a few things I believe set us apart from the rest of the industry and it's the ideas and rules I had in mind when creating this brand. That is making sure we create <em>quality, effective, and ethically conscious skincare products that don't hurt your pockets.</em>  Being able to find products that actually work, align with your ehtical ideas such as sustainability and cruelty free products, don't have any icky ingredients in them, and won't cost a fourtune, is really hard. That is exactly what we make. We collide the world of "clean" beauty, and clinically proven grade ingredients to create the best of both worlds.  </p>
